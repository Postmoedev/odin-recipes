# Odin-Recipes-Project
This project is about learning html basics by creating a recipe website.
This project covers html basics such as using the html boilerplate, headings, using unordered lists and ordered lists, adding images while utilizing the alt, width, and height attributes, and creating and using links.
I hope to stylize and structure this website properly in the near future by learning css and javascript to make the website provide a better viewer experience.
Overall, this project was a great learning experience and a fun first project!
